The Repository Contains the Recruitment Test For One Of The Company That asked me to take.

**Problem Statement**

**Pricing**

**Background**

A basket of items is a common ecommerce feature, allowing users to add several items to their virtual basket and pay for all the items at once. In addition, merchants sometimes choose to offer promotional discounts for certain items or collections of items. Correctly calculating the total price is important for displaying the right amount to the customer as the basket is updated as well as charging the right amount when paying.

**Task**

Please implement C# code that calculates the total price of a given set of items. The solution should support applying discount rules, specifically a &quot;buy two, get one free&quot; deal for certain items or combinations of items.

**Notes**

- The implementation should be a fully working maintainable pricing solution that is of production quality
- This task doesn&#39;t require implementing a shopping basket or an eCommerce web site
- As a guideline, please aim to spend about two hours working on a solution for this task
- The task and / or solution shouldn&#39;t be publicly shared, eg. using your GitHub profile or other channels
